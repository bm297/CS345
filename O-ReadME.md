Step 2,3,4 = DONE


Notes:
I misread the html htm part about changing attribute codes. i believe its an easy fix.
My mistake was that i just had to change some words that were tags but i actually had to change all the words between the tags. ---FIXED ---

For besho:
your assignments on docIDs are off when i introduced new files and folders. check on it when you can.
