# CS345-desktop_search_engine


well step 2 is mostly done.i wrote 2 python files. the fy.py just runs the tokenizer. it just relies on the step1.txt being in the same folder.



Notes:
I misread the html htm part about changing attribute codes. i believe its an easy fix.
My mistake was that i just had to change some words that were tags but i actually had to change all the words between the tags. ---FIXED ---

For besho:
your assignments on docIDs are off when i introduced new files and folders. check on it when you can.
